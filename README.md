# housing-market-project

We chose a housing market analysis to analyze market trends over time, including median prices as well as rent prices for several cities across the United States. We used Zillow and census information to create databases for the rental and housing prices over the past ten years. 

Our data was ethically retrieved from public data sources. Housing information should be transparent and easily accessible. All of the laws surrounding housing information forbids discrimination to certain groups of people when renting or buying houses. Publishing the data of the housing market empowers people to make decisions when it comes to renting or buying property. People can find surrounding property values as well as fair market pricing for rent. This data helps with realistic expectations of costs for different cities. 

We used VSCode and Jupyter Notebook to analyze our data. Dataframes for each set of data was created. We used Sklearn and Collections libraries in our analysis, which were not gone covered in class. We found the highest and lowest value city average housing prices as well as highest and lowest average city rental prices. Many of the highest rental costs can be found in California. The highest housing prices can be found all over America from California to Massachusetts and Hawaii.

Our flask allows users to look up a city and find the maximum and minimum rental costs or housing prices based on cities with the date of the data. The homepage lists the two available routes and how to use them. Users can copy and paste the urls and change the city and state to find the prices for a city. If the city is not in our created database users will get a message that says "Column does not exist in table."

Our conclusions based on our data were, based on the data we analyzed, both rental and housing costs have experienced a significant surge since February 2015. As suggested by our analysis, it is clear that housing values are much higher on the Western side of the US compared to the East, specifically the Southeast region. The data also suggested that California is by far the most expensive state to rent, which is shown by the top 5 most expensive cities to rent all being located in California. The top 5 months with the highest increases in rental rates came in the year of 2021, we believe to be due to the pandemic. With the exception of Los Angeles, the top 5 months with the highest home value increases came after the pandemic as well. Both housing and rental prices have steadily increased, but both have seen a dramatic surge since the pandemic began.

Some limitations of our data to consider are limited coverage, data accuracy, sampling bias, and limited data variables. Zillow's data may not cover all regions comprehensively. It may be more robust in urban or densely populated areas and less so in rural or remote regions. Data inaccuracies could skew maximum and minimum values, leading to misleading conclusions. The properties listed on Zillow may not be representative of the entire housing market. Certain types of properties or sellers may be overrepresented or underrepresented, leading to biases in the data. Not all the factors that influence housing prices can be included in this information. Factors such as neighborhood characteristics, school quality, crime rates, and economic indicators can significantly affect housing prices but are not in Zillow's data.
