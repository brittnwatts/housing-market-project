# housing-market-project

We chose a housing market analysis to analyze market trends over time, including median prices as well as rent prices for several cities across the United States. We used Zillow and census information to create databases for the rental and housing prices over the past ten years. 

Our data was ethically retrieved from public data sources. Housing information should be transparent and easily accessible. All of the laws surrounding housing information forbids discrimination to certain groups of people when renting or buying houses. Publishing the data of the housing market empowers people to make decisions when it comes to renting or buying property. People can find surrounding property values as well as fair market pricing for rent. This data helps with realistic expectations of costs for different cities. 

We used VSCode and Jupyter Notebook to analyze our data. Dataframes for each set of data was created. We used Sklearn and Collections libraries in our analysis, which were not gone covered in class. We found the highest and lowest value city average housing prices as well as highest and lowest average city rental prices. Many of the highest rental costs can be found in California. The highest housing prices can be found all over America from California to Massachusetts and Hawaii. 


Our flask allows users to look up a city and find the maximum and minimum rental costs or housing prices based on cities with the date of the data. The homepage lists the two available routes and how to use them. Users can copy and paste the urls and change the city and state to find the prices for a city. If the city is not in our created database users will get a message that says "Column does not exist in table."
